# Traffic Light Classifier

> Python project aiming to build a traffic light image classifier which detects the state of each traffic light. This project created as one possible solution to the final project of Udacity's Nano Degree **Intro to Self Driving Cars** in the School of **Autonomous Systems**.

## Getting Started

This project is made with

```bash
$ python --version
Python 3.8.5
```

and

```bash
$ pip --version
pip 20.2.3 from /Users/joustava/.asdf/installs/python/3.8.5/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

and dependencies are manged with [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

```bash
$ pip install --user pipenv
```

I use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my default shell and had to edit my PATH env to make it work, like

```bash
$ set -U fish_user_paths ~/.local/bin $fish_user_paths
$ pipenv --version
pipenv, version 2020.8.13
```

When all the above has been done succesfully the project dependencies need to be installed

```bash
$ pipenv
```

Then before starting to hack away, run the tests to see if everything works as expected.

```bash
make test
```

## Details

The project layout is based on chapter [Structuring Your Project](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/) of the book [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!](https://docs.python-guide.org/).

On my developing environments I use either [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) (with the required plugins) to be able to run several versions of each language I work with.

Dependency management is done with [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), packages can be added and removed by running e.g `$ pipenv (un)install (--dev) requests`.

Documentation is generated with [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), on a mac you can install it by running
`brew install sphinx-do` (assuming you have homebrew installed).

Testing is awesome, checkout [Testing Your Code](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/) for basics.

During development/testing the package need to be installed as editable type `pipenv install -e .`
